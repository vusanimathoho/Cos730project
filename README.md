Emergency Road Service Help System is a web based system. The aim of the system is to provide road assistance for customers who are in need of fuel or mechanic service.
The petrol attendant will offer fuel delivery service, while the mechanic will be offering tyre change and vehicle repairs. The system will provide customers with the 
ability to search for the nearest service center and request for assistance.
